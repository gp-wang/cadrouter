Implementation: maze router with A-star heuristic and global routing framework



Work summary:

Implemented an router, including
•	implementation of ADT (Priority Queue, Linked List), 
•	implementation of an closest_pair algorithm with O(nlogn) complexity. 
•	L-shape route, Z-shape route, RRR, maze-routing with A* heuristic
